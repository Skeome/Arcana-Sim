# Turn Structure

## Phase 0: Setup
- Draw 7 cards

## Phase 1: Attunement
- Draw 1 card
- Gain 2 Aether (up to 16)
## Phase 2: Memorization

### You may take one of the following actions:
- Summon a Spirit: You may place one Spirit card from your hand onto a Spirit Card slot

- Prepare a Spell: You may place one Spell card from your hand into a Spell card slot. You may either:
- - Place the card in an empty Spell slot

- - Stack the card on top of an existing identical copy, up to three copies

- Replace a Spell: You may discard a card in your Spell slot and place a new Spell in that slot on the same turn during this phase

- Use player ability, if set

## Phase 3: Invocation
You may now use the cards in your slots that were prepared in the previous phase.
- Activate Spells: You may pay Aether to activate spells, choosing up to three copies of the card (stack) to use.
- - The Aether cost depends on how many cards you discard from a stack (up to 3 cards per stack)

- Attack with Spirits: You may pay Aether to attack with Spirits.
- - If your opponent has Spirits in play, you must attack the other Spirits, otherwise you may attack the opponent directly
- - Combat is turn based: when you attack an opponent, you do not take damage (unless the spirit has a "counter-attack," but we can skip that for now)
- - - Damage taken is tracked with tokens or dice

## Phase 4: Respite
- End Phase
- "until end of turn" effects expire (if implemented)
